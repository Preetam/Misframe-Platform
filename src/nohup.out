    body: '<p style=\'font-style: italic\'>This was my 2-inch response to a talk by Richard Hamming, called &ldquo;You and Your Research.&rdquo; The actual talk is, from what I have heard, available on YouTube. It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

I think it’s a difficult choice—to give up, but it’s definitely a necessary choice, and one that we must learn to make.</p><p>Hamming talks about what it takes to produce significant and meaningful results. I agree completely with his claim that an emotional commitment is an essential aspect.

In order to push yourself to get what you want, you really have to focus fully on the problem.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p style=\'font-style: italic\'>This was my 2-inch response to a talk by Richard Hamming, called &ldquo;You and Your Research.&rdquo; The actual talk is, from what I have heard, available on YouTube. It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

I think it’s a difficult choice—to give up, but it’s definitely a necessary choice, and one that we must learn to make.</p><p>Hamming talks about what it takes to produce significant and meaningful results. I agree completely with his claim that an emotional commitment is an essential aspect.

In order to push yourself to get what you want, you really have to focus fully on the problem.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web.

While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work.

We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good.

We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p style=\'font-style: italic\'>This was my 2-inch response to a talk by Richard Hamming, called &ldquo;You and Your Research.&rdquo; The actual talk is, from what I have heard, available on YouTube. It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good.

We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all.

We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web.

While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work.

We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good.

We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p style=\'font-style: italic\'>This was my 2-inch response to a talk by Richard Hamming, called &ldquo;You and Your Research.&rdquo; The actual talk is, from what I have heard, available on YouTube. It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album.

You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work.

We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all.

Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price.

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good.

    body: '<p style=\'font-style: italic\'>This was my 2-inch response to a talk by Richard Hamming, called &ldquo;You and Your Research.&rdquo; The actual talk is, from what I have heard, available on YouTube.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web.

While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work.

We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good.

We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p style=\'font-style: italic\'>This was my 2-inch response to a talk by Richard Hamming, called &ldquo;You and Your Research.&rdquo; The actual talk is, from what I have heard, available on YouTube. It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good.

We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all.

We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web.

While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work.

We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good.

We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different.

While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music.

Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good.

We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

    body: '<p>I want to avoid technical subjects as much as possible. It\'s not that I don\'t want to write about them, because I do. I just think that my audience (including my future self) would probably fall asleep reading about this. I think this is one of those things which deserves to be written. With that aside, let\'s roll.</p>  <p>Hold on... this isn\'t WordPress! That is true. While I love WordPress and all of its magical qualities, it\'s a bit complicated. I like to know how things work and I like to have control. I just didn\'t get that with WordPress. I wanted another platform. I wanted something better.</p>  <p>Abi Gopal asked me how to make a blog with Node. I told him the truth&mdash;I had no idea. I guess that\'s when I started to think about writing a platform with Node. After a few nights of 2 AM coding, I had something substantial.</p>  <h2>The specifics!</h2> <p>This is on a <a href="http://bitcable.com/">Bitcable</a> VPS running Ubuntu 11.10. You have to start with something great, right? Then comes Node. That\'s obvious. For the database, I\'m using CouchDB. I just find it easier to use than MongoDB, and its speed is more than acceptable.</p>  <p>I\'m using a few modules with Node. Express, for the web framework, Jade and Stylus for the templating, and nano to interact with CouchDB. Nothing else comes to mind... I like to keep things simple.</p>  <h2>The design.</h2><p>I created the design from scratch. Most of my designs look similar, and I\'m trying to get out of that. It\'s not complicated at all, but I think it looks nice.</p>  <p>The background is fantastic. It\'s a subtle pattern from <a href="http://subtlepatterns.com/">subtlepatterns.com</a>. On top of that, everything is either black or white. I change the opacity of the backgrounds to get a neat, glassy effect. The only color is the blue. If you know me personally, you\'ll know why I chose that blue.</p>  <p>I really like the font. It\'s <a href="http://font.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. I use Ubuntu (the OS) everywhere, and I\'ve gotten used to seeing that font. It\'s unique, clean, and it just rocks.</p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/XCtMy.png"/>  <p>That\'s enough for now.</p>',

I\'ll go into the technical stuff later. I couldn\'t have done it without the amazing people who have developed Node.js, Express, Jade, Stylus, CouchDB, etc. Those people rock.</p><p>Enough about the geeky stuff? Sure, let\'s move on. I\'ve named this site &ldquo;Misframe.&rdquo; To frame is to create or formulate. To misframe is to do that incorrectly. I always find myself disappointed at things being done the wrong way, and the fault is found almost always at the origins. My best piece of advice would be to do things right from the beginning.</p><p>So what\'s the point of this blog? Well right now, I don\'t know. It\'ll be about anything and everything. I\'ll try to keep things interesting. In the end, this blog is mainly for myself. I\'ve had a web presence for <em>many</em> years&mdash;at least 8. In fact, there are still my forum posts from <em>way</em> back that I look at for fun. I\'ve learned to live in the moment. There\'s just no time to step back and look at where I am right now. Hopefully, I\'ll have some time later on to look back at this stuff.</p><p>You know, you can click on the post title and read/write some comments! <em>Exciting</em>, isn\'t it?</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music.

You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p style=\'font-style: italic\'>This was my 2-inch response to a talk by Richard Hamming, called &ldquo;You and Your Research.&rdquo; The actual talk is, from what I have heard, available on YouTube. It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I want to avoid technical subjects as much as possible. It\'s not that I don\'t want to write about them, because I do. I just think that my audience (including my future self) would probably fall asleep reading about this. I think this is one of those things which deserves to be written. With that aside, let\'s roll.</p>  <p>Hold on... this isn\'t WordPress! That is true. While I love WordPress and all of its magical qualities, it\'s a bit complicated. I like to know how things work and I like to have control. I just didn\'t get that with WordPress. I wanted another platform. I wanted something better.</p>  <p>Abi Gopal asked me how to make a blog with Node. I told him the truth&mdash;I had no idea. I guess that\'s when I started to think about writing a platform with Node. After a few nights of 2 AM coding, I had something substantial.</p>  <h2>The specifics!</h2> <p>This is on a <a href="http://bitcable.com/">Bitcable</a> VPS running Ubuntu 11.10. You have to start with something great, right? Then comes Node. That\'s obvious. For the database, I\'m using CouchDB. I just find it easier to use than MongoDB, and its speed is more than acceptable.</p>  <p>I\'m using a few modules with Node. Express, for the web framework, Jade and Stylus for the templating, and nano to interact with CouchDB. Nothing else comes to mind... I like to keep things simple.</p>  <h2>The design.</h2><p>I created the design from scratch. Most of my designs look similar, and I\'m trying to get out of that. It\'s not complicated at all, but I think it looks nice.</p>  <p>The background is fantastic. It\'s a subtle pattern from <a href="http://subtlepatterns.com/">subtlepatterns.com</a>. On top of that, everything is either black or white. I change the opacity of the backgrounds to get a neat, glassy effect. The only color is the blue. If you know me personally, you\'ll know why I chose that blue.</p>  <p>I really like the font. It\'s <a href="http://font.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. I use Ubuntu (the OS) everywhere, and I\'ve gotten used to seeing that font. It\'s unique, clean, and it just rocks.</p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/XCtMy.png"/>  <p>That\'s enough for now.</p>',

I\'ll go into the technical stuff later. I couldn\'t have done it without the amazing people who have developed Node.js, Express, Jade, Stylus, CouchDB, etc. Those people rock.</p><p>Enough about the geeky stuff? Sure, let\'s move on. I\'ve named this site &ldquo;Misframe.&rdquo; To frame is to create or formulate. To misframe is to do that incorrectly. I always find myself disappointed at things being done the wrong way, and the fault is found almost always at the origins. My best piece of advice would be to do things right from the beginning.</p><p>So what\'s the point of this blog? Well right now, I don\'t know. It\'ll be about anything and everything. I\'ll try to keep things interesting. In the end, this blog is mainly for myself. I\'ve had a web presence for <em>many</em> years&mdash;at least 8. In fact, there are still my forum posts from <em>way</em> back that I look at for fun. I\'ve learned to live in the moment. There\'s just no time to step back and look at where I am right now. Hopefully, I\'ll have some time later on to look back at this stuff.</p><p>You know, you can click on the post title and read/write some comments! <em>Exciting</em>, isn\'t it?</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price.

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong.

    body: '<p style=\'font-style: italic\'>This was my 2-inch response to a talk by Richard Hamming, called &ldquo;You and Your Research.&rdquo; The actual talk is, from what I have heard, available on YouTube. It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p style=\'font-style: italic\'>This was my 2-inch response to a talk by Richard Hamming, called &ldquo;You and Your Research.&rdquo; The actual talk is, from what I have heard, available on YouTube. It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do.

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',

In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right?

    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all.

    title: 'Thoughts on working',
    body: '<p style=\'font-style: italic\'>This was my 2-inch response to a talk by Richard Hamming, called &ldquo;You and Your Research.&rdquo; The actual talk is, from what I have heard, available on YouTube. It\'s definitely something to look up.</p><p>I think one of the most obvious yet important statements in the entire talk is “you have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.” As students, we’re constantly dealing with situations where we just have too much to do. As we grow up, we find that we can’t do everything, and some things must be neglected. I think it’s a difficult choice—to give up, but it’s definitely a necessary choice, and one that we must learn to make.</p><p>Hamming talks about what it takes to produce significant and meaningful results. I agree completely with his claim that an emotional commitment is an essential aspect. I find that when it comes to my work, the best results aren’t only caused by an emotional commitment or sincere dedication. It’s usually an obsession. In order to push yourself to get what you want, you really have to focus fully on the problem.</p>',

    title: 'Nvidia and CES',
    body: '<p>From <a href=\'http://ces.cnet.com/8301-33370_1-57344518/faster-phones-and-more-ice-cream-sandwich-at-ces-2012/\'>CNET</a>:</p><blockquote><p>One of the biggest stories at the 2011 show was the mainstreaming of dual-core phones. Not only did we get the Atrix, but also Motorola rolled out the Droid Bionic and LG presented the Optimus 2X (aka the T-Mobile G2x). More dual-core followed throughout 2011, but even the latest batch of handsets would be left in the dustbin by a quad-core device.</p><p>Nothing is official yet, but rumors over the past two months have pointed to a possible HTC device with the new Nvidia Tegra 3 1.5GHz quad-core processor. If you\'re keeping track that\'s the same processor that turned up in the recent Asus Transformer Prime.</p><p>At the time of this writing, HTC hasn\'t scheduled a CES event, but Nvidia is hosting a press conference January 9 where it could make a Tegra 3 announcement. And since we doubt that it would move ahead without a manufacturer partner, we expect that a handset or tablet manufacturer will join the company onstage.</p></blockquote><h2>My opinion</h2><p>CES was <em>huge</em> for Nvidia this year. It reached its 52-week high soon after the event. What can we expect next January? I\'m not too sure. Nvidia has a reputation for developing high-performance products, but is that really what people want? Tegra 2 is amazing. It offers exactly what people need&mdash;performance and battery life. It\'s not overkill, and it\'s not for the enthusiasts. It was a great release.</p><p>Tegra 3 is also great, but I don\'t think it\'s for everyone. Most people don\'t need a quad core in their pockets! What we\'re seeing is the whole &ldquo;because we can&rdquo; gimmick. Technology is evolving faster than we can adapt to it. The technology sector has been a little rough lately. I\'m just going to watch Nvidia this time.</p>',

    title: 'Goods and Services on the Web',
    body: '<p>I don\'t really have an introduction for this one. I honestly just wrote everything/anything I thought about. Hopefully you\'ll get something out of this. I introduce my forecast about business on the web, so let\'s see if I\'m right.</p><h2>Two examples.</h2> <p>I’ll start with something people can’t really relate to: fonts. In my case, there were two choices to make. FontSpring or Typekit. FontSpring sells fonts with a one-time fee. You buy specific fonts, use them, and that’s it. You have the files, and you can do (almost) whatever you want with them. It’s great.</p> <p>Typekit is a bit different. They run a subscription-based model where you pay a yearly fee and use whatever fonts you want. There are limits: you can’t download the fonts, and you can only use them on the web. For most people, this isn’t a big issue. Sometimes, it’s a deal breaker.</p> <p>A tough choice? Not exactly. While these two business strategies seem completely different, <em>they don’t have the same purpose</em>. You don’t really have to choose one over the other. The essential question is basically, “how much do I need?” If you’re not going to use a bunch of fonts, use FontSpring. You might end up saving a <em>lot</em> of money. On the other hand, if you find yourself using a variety of fonts and don’t want to drop hundreds of dollars on each one, choose Typekit.</p> <p>Now, here’s an example that almost everyone can figure out: music. We’ve all seen Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, and the others, but which one’s the right choice?</p> <p>Let’s say you’re a casual listener. You can either buy an album, which is around $10, or you can get a month-long subscription from Spotify, which is $9.99 per month, and listen to the same album. Yes, I’m assuming you’ll get the premium membership. Just roll with it. This situation isn’t a whole lot different from the fonts. You can download an album and do whatever you want with it, but you don’t have that much freedom with Spotify.</p> <p>Again, if you’re a person who buys a couple of albums a month, then you’d obviously choose to go with Spotify. It’s all about <em>how much</em>.</p> <h2>The rise of services.</h2> <p>Now that we’ve thought about some things, I’ll establish my thesis. We’re going to see a rise in subscription-based services on the web. Just forget about one-time fees. It’s inevitable because it’s the way things work. Payment for intangible goods and services is <em>inherently</em> subscription-based because it’s not like we actually own those products. I’d rather let my music be a service rather than a good. I get more choices, and I end up paying a lot less.</p> <p>Another idea is software. Paying for software is trash. It’s just wrong. We’re at a point in time where it doesn’t make sense to sell software anymore. There’s just no market for it. I’m not against proprietary software at all. Proprietary software isn’t always a bad idea. It’s just that selling software is bad. This will be the topic of another blog post, but if you’re going to develop software and sell it as a good, STOP. Do not misframe.</p> <p>(Just dumping thoughts here... sorry. If I actually tried to make this good, I’d never get around to publishing.)</p> <p>Services are good. I claim that you can’t succeed by selling intangible goods online anymore. Subscription-based models are the way to go.</p> <h2>What’s next?</h2> <p>Books, movies, fonts, magazines, etc. Digital media. I’d like to see subscriptions for those. We’ve already seen most of them already, and Amazon has recently taken up a venture to offer a Netflix-like service for books. Excellent! This is the way we <em>should</em> be moving. Why? Because it works. We have also seen subscription games from companies like OnLive. We need more of them, because I think the only issue is price. As soon as more publishers and developers realize the benefits of this new model, we’ll see better prices.</p> <p>Yeah, I’m done. Not bad for a first interesting blog post, right? Comments are appreciated&mdash;just be civilized.</p>',
